Design of WebUpdate</a></h2>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="faq_exec">
1) Why does WebUpdate provides a separate application for handling the update process ? Why I cannot use the provided library and link that to the application to update so that I can ship a single executable ?</a></h3>
Initially, this WebUpdate project provided only a library and it was designed so that the application to update would have linked it and created the update dialog window directly. Even if this approach has the advantage of being more compact (a single executable file which updates itself) it makes impossible to update the executable and the files it is using !<p>
In fact, while the program is running, its executable file, and eventually any other data file which the program has open, are "locked" and thus they cannot be replaced/renamed/deleted. This makes this approach unworkable: almost any program needs to update its executable file.<p>
The most used strategy is to keep the program-to-update and the updater separed and this is also the approach used by WebUpdate. In this way, when the user clicks the "Update this program" link (it can be any type of control; see <a class="el" href="tutorial.html">The WebUpdate tutorial</a>) in the program-to-update, the program executes asynchronously the WebUpdater application and immediately exits itself. So, the program and its data files can be safely updated from WebUpdater since the program-to-update is not running. Obviously you then have some problems to update the WebUpdater itself... but there is a simple workaround: look at <a class="el" href="updateupdater.html">How to update the WebUpdater</a>.<p>
The library which is built by WebUpdate sources is only for advanced features (see <a class="el" href="customaction.html">How to create a new custom action</a>).<h3><a class="anchor" name="faq_xml">
2) Why using XML for the scripts ?</a></h3>
Why not ? It's easy to parse and human readable. Most important: you don't have to learn new syntax rules created ad hoc for WebUpdate.<p>
&lt;br/&gt;<h2><a class="anchor" name="usage">
Using WebUpdate</a></h2>
<h3><a class="anchor" name="faq_hide">
1) How can I avoid that the user looks into my local XML file and my XRC file ?</a></h3>
A simple way to do this is to just rename the files with a different extension and use the <code>--xml</code> and the <code>--xrc</code> WebUpdater options to specify the new file names. This is a typical trick which usually keeps naive users away from the application's core files; a more secure way, for XRC resources at least, is to convert the XRC file in a compiled XRS file using the <code>wxrc</code> utility shipped with wxWidgets.<h3><a class="anchor" name="faq_localupdates">
2) How can I use WebUpdate to take the update packages from a non-http resource ?</a></h3>
You can write your XML local &amp; remote scripts so that WebUpdate will take updates from a non-http resource (a local drive/specific folder). In order to do this, you have to modify the <code>remoteuri</code> tag content in the local XML script using the <code>file</code> protocol (e.g. <code><a href="file:/usr/local/updates,">file:/usr/local/updates,</a></code> <code><a href="file:c:/temp/updates</tt">file:c:/temp/updates&lt;/tt</a>&gt; - even on windows, use '/' and not '\' as path separator).</code><p>
<code> In this way the XML remote script can also be placed somewhere <em>locally</em>. To tell WebUpdate to use local update packages, you should use the <code>file</code> protocol also in the <code>uri</code> tags of the remote XML scripts.</code><p>
<code> Last, remember that keyword substitution is performed in all URIs so that you can write valid URIs as: <code><a href="file:$(remotedir)">file:$(remotedir)</a>mypackage.msi</code> or <code><a href="file:$(localdir)">file:$(localdir)</a>..//..//remote.xml</code>.</code><p>
<code> A typical application of "local updates" is to allow the user to update the program using a removable device (CD, DVD, floppy or whatelse). See the <code>--ask-uri</code> option in the <a class="el" href="webupdater.html">WebUpdater application reference</a> page.</code><p>
